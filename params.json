We study the impact of a unique environmental regulatory policy called mandatory participation in Cleaner Production Audit (CPA) programs on green innovation of Chinese listed companies.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### The Introduction of the Cleaner Production Audit\r\n>\r\n* Earliest-launch-time: 2002\r\n* Responsible Organization: [Ministry of Environmental Protection](http://english.mep.gov.cn/), China\r\n* Aim: To Address environmental problems that accompany rapid industrial growth, through regulating pollution-intensive\r\nfirms in various sectors\r\n* Obligation: Every participated company is obligated to disclose its pollutant emissions, conduct firm-wide CPA projects, and pass an assessment and an acceptance inspection conducted by local environmental agencies.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Key Point and Basic Results\r\n>\r\n* We distinguish environmental patents from others by matching the Chinese Patent Database with the green patent category reported by WIPO and created the firm-by-year green patent panel datasets. In the process of matching, we also classify the green patents into seven categories.\r\n* In order to investigate the characteristics of different industries, we collected and cleaned the industry-level data about energy consumption and pollutant emission. We employed a Difference-in-Difference approach to verify the positive effect of mandatory CPA participation on firms green innovation.\r\n* We identify the different kinds of cooperation body associated with its relative parent company to test the direct and indirect effects on green innovation.\r\n* Using the empirical results, we find a significant positive link between CPA participation and firmsâ€™ application for green patents. The stimulative effect is stronger on the firms of higher energy intensity and waste emission.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Chinese Public Firm Patent Map\r\n>\r\nIn order to illustrate our database to others, we re-sort the data and generate a city-by-year patent dataset. Based on the derived dataset, we create some figures: **Coming Soon**\r\n* [Chinese Public Firm Patent Map-Basic Version](./PatentMap.html)\r\n* [Chinese Public Firm Patent Map-Comparison of the Firms Participating in CPA or NOT](./PatentMap_CPA.html)\r\n* [Chinese Public Firm Patent Map-Number of Patents Per Firm](./PatentMap_CPA_perfirm.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n### Contact Us\r\n>\r\n* Prof. Jingbo Cui: jbcui2013@gmail.com\r\n* Zhenxuan Wang: whuxuan@outlook.com\r\n\r\n\r\n",
